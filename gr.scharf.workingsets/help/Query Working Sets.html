The content of the working set is updated dynamically as the files change in the workspace.</p><h2 id="Regular_Expressions">Regular Expressions</h2><p>The current version contains one regular expression per line that matches the (project) path of the files. 
If the line starts with a '-' (minus) the matching files are removed form the working set.</p><p>Here are a few examples. To match python files that do not contain test cases you could use</p><pre>   .*.py
   -.*test.*
</pre><p>This first matches any .py file and in the second line it removes all files containing 'test'.</p><p>Here is a bit more complicated pattern:</p><pre>   .*\.coffee
   -.*static.*
   -.*ckann_chro.*
   -.*patches.*
   -.*spec.*
   -.*grunt.*
   -.*node_.*
   -/h/.*
</pre><p>For performance it might be better to use a single expression.</p></body></html>
